            <h2>About The Busters</h2>
            <p>Greenhouse Busters began with a simple realization: the world is in need of a clear, easy way to comprehend and fight against global warming. We wanted something that would present easy information and doable, green solutions that everyone could take up in daily life. The vision was to educate and equip people with the information and resources to make a tangible impact from the very confines of the house and society they live in.</p>
            <p>Our advocacy is all about reducing carbon dioxide. We are dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and are committed to this mission. or waste reduction, and inspiring earth-caring activities. No matter how small a small problem is, it can lead to significant change. </p>

            <p>My name is Ethan Gabriel M. Gisma, and I am the creator of Greenhouse Busters. I'm a grade 9 student of Philippine Science High School, Southern Mindanao Campus. I created this project to combine my passion for coding with my idea for environmental sustainability. My mission is to offer individuals not only useful and readily accessible information about greenhouse gas emission reductions. But allow them to promote their own ideas on how to reduce these gases.</p>
